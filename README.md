This project is about Implementing a  Continuous User Authentication system utilizing behavioral biometrics, specifically based on the HMOG dataset. Developing machine learning models to analyze and authenticate users in real-time, leveraging unique behavioral patterns such as Gait patterns and keystroke dynamics.
We did this project using H-MOG dataset which consists of  Gait Patterns and  behavioral biometrics of Hundred People.
In the above code we have only used accelerometer and gyroscope raw sensor data of 5 people .
This above code files consists different features we have extracted one using Statistical Features and the other Shape Descriptor features
This project is currently under Progress.
